#### Abstract
Political Campaign Communication: Principles and Practice, Ninth Edition uses a speech-communication perspective to examine how elective politics contributes to our knowledge and understanding of the electoral process. Through historical and contemporary examples, this book offers readers a realistic understanding of the strategic and tactical communication choices candidates and their managers make as they wage the campaign.

One of the most comprehensive and consistently updated volumes available on the subject, the ninth edition of Political Campaign Communication: Principles and Practice traces political communication from its roots in public speeches and campaign whistle-stops to the current explosion of information in the viral hothouse of social media, making it essential reading for students in communication and political science courses.
