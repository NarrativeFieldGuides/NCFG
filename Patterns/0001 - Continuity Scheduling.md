## Summary and Considerations
Continuity Scheduling is a form of [[000x Scheduling|Scheduling]] practice for release of content which was defined in the context of advertising and political campaigns. The objective of continuity scheduling is maintaining constant awareness of the content’s subject matter within the target audience. Continuity Scheduling entails the forward planning of regular and unrelenting release or placement of content in front of the target audience for the entire length of a campaign.

### Best Used Where
- The success of other campaign deployments relies on constant awareness.
- The intention of the campaign is to cause “shocks to consciousness” or negative emotion.

### Risks
- Frustration: If your messaging causes unintended negative emotion either due to misinterpretation or, in the case of advertising, due to it getting in the way of an individual accessing content, Continuity Scheduling increases the likelihood of blowback. 
- Expense: Continuity Scheduling which relies on ad placement can be notably more expensive than other scheduling practices.
