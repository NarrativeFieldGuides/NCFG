The [[The Narrative Campaign Field Guide - 1st Edition|Narrative Campaign Field Guide]] is being developed here into a global online repository that will evolve and adapt in real-time to help individuals, researchers, policymakers, and researchers develop effective [[Narrative Campaigns]] and combat misinformation. We do this by working together to educate and empower people to detect, monitor, and respond to patterns of narrative influence online. 

The network effects of an increasingly connected society generate an interesting asymmetry: 

-   There is an unfathomable volume of new information being generated each day by myriad actors, large and small
    
-   It is becoming increasingly easy for a small number of relatively minor actors to have outsized impact by targeting and generating a relatively small amount of that information
    

This paradox creates new vulnerabilities that erode personal, community and global well-being. However, this type of asymmetry is not novel - cybersecurity saw a very similar paradox, and saw notable improvement upon the introduction of Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits (CVE) databasing. The generation of common repositories for case reports, patterns of practice, and warnings to ensure that everyone that had the potential to be impacted had the ability to update their thinking and alert others to threats. 

It is our belief that this approach to cyber-security could be repurposed for use in cognitive-security in the interest of building a more cooperative, positive society fostering a resilient, inquisitive, and empathetic population. The goal is to generate a single global repository for patterns of risk and practice in narrative influence, including real-time case-reporting, corroboration of digital events, and archiving of digital artifacts. It is the aim of this work to bring the various siloed data, people and methods together under one umbrella, allowing patterns to be detected and emergent collaborative solutions to be developed that are not possible today. 

#### Structure of the Field Guide

The Field Guide was built around the concept of “pattern collection”, first formalized by Christopher Alexander in his architectural book [A Pattern Language]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language)), which later inspired the generation of “software design patterns” and other non-architectectural implementations. Each pattern of narrative influence is given a number and contains a number of sections which allows for comparability between them. There is an index of all of the listed patterns [[Pattern Index|here]].

#### About Us

This project stems from an eclectic group of researchers brought together originally to write a whitepaper for a [leading think tank](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/geotech-center/) in support of COVID vaccine information strategies to improve public health. This group, representing academia, national defense and industry, soon determined that there was an immediate need for a toolkit that combined their knowledge, practices and insights, and within a few months during the pandemic, they published the Narrative Campaign Field Guide. That book was the beginning, not the end.  This online platform is the natural extension of that work, opening up the collaboration of a number of practitioners to the rest of the world, to build a living, evolving global resource. It is our goal that this becomes a forum for positive civic engagement and community building - one of the most important, if not the only way to leverage technology and information for good, and to combat negative actors and information.
